Rooms have been  reserved and will be paid as a group for all the participants for three days (Arrival date: July 25, 2018; Departure date: July 28, 2018). If you want to arrive earlier or stay later, you can submit an individual reservation request here: [SFU Guest Accommodations](http://www.sfu.ca/stayhere/reservation.html) by selecting "individual guest booking" and clicking on "request a booking." You can then fill out the page and will need to submit a credit card that will be stored in a secure online vault until the day before your arrival. It would be helpful for the front desk of SFU Guest Accommodations if you indicate in the comment section that you are part of the 20th IMS New Researchers Conference, but are booking a personal stay on either end of the conference. If you are by yourselves, it is recommended that you book a Private Residence Room on the individual traveler floor, and can then room switch when the booking with the conference begins to your townhouse room.
