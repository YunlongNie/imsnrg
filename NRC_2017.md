## Logistics

### Hotel

Conference participants will be staying at the [Inn at The Collonade Baltimore](http://www.colonnadebaltimore.com/).

### Restaurant Recommendations

Friday evening the NRC participants are encouraged to venture out to enjoy some local restaurants. A few neighborhoods to check out include 

* Charles Village -- The area to the east of the Homewood campus has a number of restaurants that cater to students.
* Remington -- The area to the south of campus has many new restaurants (including R House) as well as some old favorites.
* Hampden -- The area up the hill to the west of campus is a quirky neighborhood with lots of options primarily along 36th Street.
* Mount Vernon -- Farther south, past Penn Station, is the Mount Vernon neighborhood which has many good restaurants alongside some great museums and small music venues.

Some other neighborhoods to check out in Baltimore include Fells Points and Federal Hill which are near the Inner Harbor where the Convention Center is located. There are plenty of great options in those areas that you can enjoy tonight or over the course of JSM.
