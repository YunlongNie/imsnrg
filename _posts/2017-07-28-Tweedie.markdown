The New Researchers Group is pleased to congratulate Professor Rina Foygel Barber from the Department of Statistics at University of Chicago as the winner of the [Tweedie New Researcher Award](http://www.imstat.org/awards/tweedie.html) from the IMS. This morning Jon Wellner, the current president of the IMS, presented Rina with a plaque to commemorate the award. This presentation was followed by Rina's [great talk]({{ site.baseurl }}/conferences/nrc_invited_abstracts.html#rina-foygel-barber-tweedie-award-winner) on her "knockoff" strategy for false discovery estimation, model selection, and confidence intervals.
